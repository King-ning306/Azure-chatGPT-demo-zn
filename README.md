## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your local machine
- An API key and endpoint from Azure OpenAI portal

### Installation

1. Clone the project to your local machine
2. Create a `.env` file in the root folder of the project
3. Add your API key and endpoint to the `.env` file using the following format:

   ```
   API_KEY=yourgpt35apikey
   API_URL=https://$yourendpoint
   GPT_4_API_KEY=yourgpt4apikey
   GPT_4_API_URL=https://$yourgpt4endpoint
   AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=your-azure-storage-connection-string
   ```

4. (Optional) Add extra features with `PROMPT_REPO_URLS` and `AZURE_TTS`:

   - `PROMPT_REPO_URLS` is a JSON object containing the user name and the URL of the prompt file:
     ```

     ```
     For the `user1prompts.json` content format, check the example file at `./public/prompts.json`.

   - `AZURE_TTS` is a JSON object containing the subscription key and the endpoint of the Azure Text-to-Speech service:

     ```
     AZURE_TTS={"subscriptionKey":"your subscription key","endpoint":"your endpoint"}
     ```
   - `API_DALLE_URL` is the endpoint of the DALL-E API service:
     ```
     API_DALLE_URL=yourdalleapiurl
     API_DALLE_KEY=yourdalleapikey
     ```
     
5. Install the necessary packages:
